01 11.

Further‚ X and Z are said 10 be a combination
of two 0011301131113, and therefore are not termed
single, but double 0011301131113, 33 implying the force
of two: For example, 110 0311 X quasi Eos, or (33
301110 would have it) 1033 31111 Ζ (which the Latius

To 111030 110 may well adde our Consonant W,
