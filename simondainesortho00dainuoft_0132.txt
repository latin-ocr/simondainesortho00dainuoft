every Syllable must fall under one and the same
accent. So that Master Coot was not well advised
to make able, acre, and the like, to be but one
Syllahle7 as shall be further demonstrated in its proper
place. For what appertaines to the derivation of the 5
word Syllable7 the Latius call it Syllaba, from the
Greeke word συλλαβή» ῖι συλλαμβάνω, quod est, Compre-
hendo: So that Syllaba, in respect of the generality
or latitude 01 1110 terme, may be taken for any com-
prehension 01· connexion in generallg but according 10
to the strict acception, as it is here taken by Gram-
marians, you have sufficiently heard the description
of it.

The division of Syllables.

Yllables therefore are generally divided into M0-15

11‹:›pthongs‚ Dipthongs‚ and Tripthongs3 the two
latter whereof we have already for our purpose
sufficiently discussed.

A Monopthong is, when a syllable is composed
of one Vowell, whether alone by it seli, asin Mono- ρο
grains, or joyned with one or more Consonants, and
that either making a whole word, or standing but
for a part.

Where you may note this difference between
the Latin and English Tongues: for the Latin hath 25
alu-aies 30 many Syllables as Vowels or Dipthcngs3
which holds 1101 30 generally in the English, as shall
hereafter be further exeinplified. Wherefore our next
step shall be 10 treat of Syllables inixt, as they be
integrall parts of a word. 30
