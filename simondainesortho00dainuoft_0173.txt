there though we have in these tables plainely
demonstrated their pronunciation by way of Ortho-
epie3 yet in What concernes Orthography or right
15 writing, Ε, in these or the like words appertaining to
either of the tables, ought not at any rate to be
omitted. Since it would argue a greater imperfectior]
in our Tongue to propose a Syllable without the
Character, than the force of a rowell, in that we attri-
20 bute a further faculty to the Liquids‚ than to the E,
taken in this manner: Which serves as a Cypher in
Arithmetick, to fill up, or supply a monle, but onely
to add the greater vigour to the precedent Letters.
And Whereas some would have acres, Tygrem and
25 diverse others of this kinde, to be written cleers,
myas, &c would custome so permit, I for my part
should never refuse the accepting a perfect syllable,
for an imperfect: by imperfect meaning, such as he
produced without the perfect force of a vowell. For
30 further satisfaction in any thing hereto concerning,
Ι remit you to my former treatises3 not loving

Tautologies, more than for necessity.
