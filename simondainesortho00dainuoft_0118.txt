E we usually pronounce not much unlike the
Greek η, or Eta, whence, I conceive, we derive the
use and pronunciation of Ee double, whose faculty
we notwithstanding for the most part usurp in the
pronunciation of the single E, sounding it almost
after the manner of the Latin I, (as it is truely uttered
by the Italians, French, Spaniards, and most nations
of Europe) but not altogether with the tongue So
much restrained. And what they call E, we write
with Ea, as in Bread, Sea, and the like.

I , according to our moderne and most commen-
dable Orthoepiists, somewhat imitates the sound of
the Latin Ei dipthong (though not altogether so full)
as it is usually pronounced; or rather, indeed, the
Greek Iota, whose force it truly retains with us,
though much differing in it among our selves: for
man)v of our Northerns especially abuse it with too
broad a sound both single and joyned with other
letters, like the Dipthong Αἱ, making no difference
in pronunciation betweene fire and fai-re. Others
againe on the contrary side, with an affected imi-
tation of the Boyond-sea pronunciation, striving to
Latinize it, would make a traveller, if not a Forreigner,
of it. But I for my part, as Ι este-eme that manner

of pronunciatum most to be practised, which best?

suits the nature of the Tongue or Language what-
soever, as most proper to it, and which hath beene
most generally received among the learned; so hold
I it the greatest property and praise of a Linguist to
attribute to each severall Tongue its native faculty:
So that I most approve in the English Tongue the
English tone, accepted and delivered by such of
our Ancestors as were able to judge, no lesse
detesting barbarisms, then ¹novelty and affectation.
