111111111113 call Ha) We for the most part, as well in
what concernes our owne Tongue‚ as the Latin, pro—
nounce it as 11 single letter, like Acie, or Hach, taken
after the Spanish pronunciatfflng who indeed come
neerest us of any Nation in Europe, concerning 5
the use and pronunciatum of this Letter: but 10 1110
French it is very (1111101111 10 produce, especially as
we doe. The Latius onely give it the Character, but
not the force of a Letter‚ and from the Greekes (who
oner niake it a note 01 aspiration, excluding it 11101110
Alphabet) produce sufficient reasons 101· it. But we
cannot doe 30; 101 without it our Tongue is altogether
imperfect: Whereupon with us it hath the prerogative
of being ranked and 03100111011 113 a Letter.

For the use, it is often proposed for difference 15
sake (as hath beenc well observed in the Latin) for
instance these two, All, 111111 Hau, &c

It may precede or be set before any 01 1110
vaels, but no Consonant, except N in Jolm (which
is ineerely a 00111111011011 01 1110 Latin word Johamzes) 20
or where it is inserted in the middle betweene two
Ctmsonants, as in Christ, &c But is apt to 311000011
111 1110 3111110 syllable any 01 111030 six Consonants,
C, P, T> R, S, G, as in Clearz'ty, Philip, Tleeorz‘e‚
Rleetorique, Slmme, Ghost. The placing it after the 25
first three 110 learned 01 1110 Greeks, notwithstanding
(especially after T) wee use it 111 many words meerely
English. After R, 01 1110 Hebrewes 111111 Arabians,
as in Gomorrha, Rhasis. After S and G we have
chiefly peculiari· to our selves. 30

W and Z differ from the other Consonants, in that
they require 111010 111011 0110 0101110111 01 syllable in their
11011011111111110113, 01 pronunciation as single letters. The
one we derive 1101111110 (1100110 Letter Zeta, whose force
it retaines: the other few Nations besides one owne- are 35

acquainted.
