the division of the syllables, you shall take the
former vowell, as proper to the former syllable: the
latter to the ensuing. Likewise when two consonants
come so together, put the one consonant to the
former syllable, the other to the latter, as in tra·- 6
ri-all, lar-yer. Except the two consonants occur-
ring in the middle of the word be one of the com-
binations instanced in the table of syllables mixt,
which be these, bl, br, ch, cl, cr, dr, dm, sl, fr,
yl, φ’, 91ι, lm, pl, pr, ph, sc, sk, sle, sl, sm, sn,10
sp, sq, st, εει), tle, tr, tw, wh, mr,- for all those
combinations that are apt to begin a word, are
likewise apt to begin a syllable, and therefore ought
not to 110 divided in the spelling. But whensoever
they happen otherwise together, either several] con- 15
sonant doubled, they be alwaies distinguished in
the division of the syllables: unlesse When it happens
in the end of a word, that two consonants be un-
necessarily doubled, as in be-yzfnne, Which is no more
but heym. 20
Secondly, when any single consonant thus oc—
curres in the middle of a word 01 diverse syllables,
you shall end the precedent syllable at the vowell,
and let the consonant fall to that succeeds3 for no
syllable in the middle of a word can end in a con- 25
sonant, unlesse the syllable following hath another
to begin withan, except it be in words derivative,
or compounded, where every syllable exacts the
letters appropriate to the simple word, as shall anon
110 further instanced. 30
Thirdly, when three consonants so happen to-
gether, you shall divide them in this manner: If
the first be a single consonant, and the two latter
3 conibination, take up the single consonant in
the former syllable, and let the other two fall to 35
the latter: and so ὲ εοηΐνω 101· it's requisite
that two of them be a combination, and be
thus
