force of one Vowell, whether joyned with one or more
Consonants. Whereby I would distinguish them from
Dipthongs, Tripthongs, and Monogranis, one of the
Individuals of a Monopthong, and not exclude Ε finall,

little force, as will anon appeare.

These, confusedly taken in their large sense, be
in a manner infinite, by reason of the great variety of
words incident to every Tongue or Language: but metho-

ciples or generall heads (as we vulgar-ly terni them)
will occurre out of these Syllables, whereon all words,
consisting of perfect Syllables, immediately depend, as
all Syllables have their immediate dependance on the

15 Letters.

These therefore are they, which by due examen
of the Letters, We have endevoured to reduce to some
certaine method, and put ol) oculo& together with their
severall rules or illustrations upon them, no lesse con-

their illustratione.

Here observo as a generall rule, that (Ξ in the end
of a word or syllable, thus following a single Conso-
nant, after a Vowell in the same syllable, is never
pronounced, but only serves to make the precedent

These be chiefly used in Syn-tmesis, or contractions,
as cvab'b for crabbcb; and in participles of the preter
tense, as [tab'b' inib'b, tob'b, vub'b.
