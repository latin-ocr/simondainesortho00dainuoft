 

,53⁴3 ORTHOEPIA, Or,

 

 

in respect of servants (as servants) in generall: not,
but that I knoxv, as there are differences and diverse
degrees of Masters, so ought there severall respects
to be had to servants, according to their place, and
manner of service. For it were absurd to think, 5
that Gentleinen in those places that may befit their
rank and fortune, though subject to their masters
call, should be tied to the obsequious termes of
every pedantique Groome. As first, he that waits
voluntary, and at his owne expence3 then Secretaries 10
in their severall ranks3 then such as serve in the
places of Gentlemen, as Ushers, and the like. Then
Clarks to nien eminent, and of quality3 and Clarks
appertaining to Offices, Factors, and Apprentices
(especially about London) men perhaps (as is usual] 15
in that kind) better derived than their Masters. In
this respect, Ι say, ought the servant to consider
the relation, or respect to be had, according to his
Masters rank, his own person, and the nature of
his service. Yet generally speaking, all servants (as 20
servants) of what nature or calling soever, ought aswell
in writing as otherwise, to shew a kinde of respect
extraordinary. Though (as I said) some be tied to
termes more incomparably strict than others.

H we write to a Parent, our stile and manner 25
of writing must be such, as may shew all dutifull
respect and obedience, exacted from a Child to a
Parent, by the Lawes of God and Nature.

If to a father or mother in law, that is by
marriage, we will tender our selves in such termes, 3ο
as may professe service and obedience3 but not
duty: At least, not equall to the former: though I
grant, we ought to think our selves tied in a firme
obligation of civill, and more than common respect.
