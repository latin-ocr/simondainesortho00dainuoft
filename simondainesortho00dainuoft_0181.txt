But now it is time that we leave our childish
digressions‚ and persist with what inore directly in-
10 tends to our Scope. Supposing therefore the premises
instructions enough, for the spelling, and finding out
any English Word; or in what may concerne the
letters either several] or combined3 it onely remaines,
that We say somewhat of the stops, or pauses be-
15 tween sentence and sentence, for the more renable
(as We call it) and distinct reading. Which notwith—
standing it properly belongs to Orthography: yet by
reason Orthographie and Orthoepie be necessarily so
concomitant (as being impossible to be perfect in
20 the one without the other) and we have so promis—
cuously used them, to shew their difference as oc-
casion served; we have thought fit to insert this
briefe peculiar treatise hereof, as a Conclusion to
our English Orthoepie3 especially since we have
25 made that the chiese title to this little booke (as
chiefly undertaking what thereto appertaines) and
that the knowledge of these stops or points is no
lesse conducible, and hypothetically necessary to
distinct and ready reading (the perfection of Orthoepie)
30 than to Orthographie‚ or right writing: though Ι will
not further inferre, knowing it so requisite to both.
