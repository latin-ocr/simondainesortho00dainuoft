or words derived, which have alwayes relation to
their primitives‚ though somtimes by way of media-
tion, as in strenyth-en of strenytlz; strenyth-en-iny
of strenytlaen, &c where E in the middle syllable is
often cut off by Syncope, and made strewyth'niny.
For a conclusion of this treatise, we will onely

add a word or two concerning Τι’ in the middle of
a word.

Τι’, before a vowell that is to begin another
syllable in the same word, is alwayes ci or si in 10
pronunciation⁷ except it followes X, or 83 or that
tho syllable following be but an addition to a com-
plete word ending in ti, happening usually in ad-
jectives of the comparative and superlative degrees
of comparison: and participles, whose verbs had their 15
termination in ti, or ty, as in lofty, loftier‚ loftiest,·
miyhlgy, miyhtv‘er, mz'yhtz'est. May, pittyz'ny, pittied, &c
which be the usuall terminations in such words. Or
lastly, where it precedes es finall, as in eitties, matie&
where it is all but one syllable &c For in these 20
cases tz' remaines alwaies proper, otherwise not. And

so let this suffice our present purpose concerning
this subJ‘ect.
