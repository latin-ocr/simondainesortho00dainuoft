and in generall, we have already said what We
determine.

The same generall rule therefore, that ties you, ,
in the superscription and body of the Letter to have
respect to the party to whom you write, and your 5
owne individuall person, ties you to the same con-
ditions in the subscription, and indorsement, or out-
ward superscription, Which wee bee still to treat of.

To a Baron therefore, or to a Lord, Wee usually
subscribe thus. Your honours most humble servant, 10
le Lord, Your eternally devoted Honourer, and
, thrioe Immble servant. 'ow' Lordslzz'ps most faitlzfzdl
and most lamnble servant. Your Lordslzz‘ps till death,
Your Lordslzztps to command, Your Honours most
obliyed, &c diverse of this sort. Subscriptions indeed 15
as common as Hackney horses on szstable rode,
to meaner persons than Barons, or Knights either,
onely leaving out Honour and Lordship. But Your
tlcrz'oe humble servant, and the like, Ι have often heard
from such as (I presume) understood not the word. 20

From Gentleman to Gentleman, if equall, and
acquainted, then Yom' assured friend to serve you,
som· truly respective friend, or the like. But if lesse
{is-quainted, or different in degree, There is so much
service professed, as they forget all friendship. No· ες»
thing then but Your servant, Your Immble servant,
Sir, at your command, and the like innumerable,
which I leave to observation and practice. Onely take
this by the way, that one of inferiour ranke writing
to a person eminent in degree above him, by the Lawes 30
of our best Secretaries, shall commonly write his name
