Here take notice, that such Substantives as in
the singular number end in f, with any of the Vowels
aforegoing, in the plurali number they change this Ῑ
into v, as life} live& mite„ mine& Ιοαῖε, locine& &Q

The Vowell is alwaies short afore ss.

ΦΕ after g, in the same Syllable, at the end of
any word, makes g to be sounded like i Consonant:
Whereforc it is against Orthography to write e in
the end of av word after g, where g is to retaine its

sonant in the end of a Syllable3 for then should it

be no longer a Liquid, when all the force is drowned :—;

in another. Thirdly e never is or ought to be inserted
but for some use: Now because e finall in our
Tongue is of so little effect or estimation, any of
these Liquids being in the highest nature of a Semi-

vowell, may justly claime as much faculty in the-

producing of a Syllable‚ whereby (the one not
