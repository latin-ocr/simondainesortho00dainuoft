70 'ORTHOEP1A, Or,

 

These stops therefore are by the Latines termed
Comma ,· (mama-colom· colom· pere‘od‘ns,· Interroyat‘im·
P((7·enlhesis,· Eoeeloematsoe Apostrophe, sive contractiom's
nota, 'ch se'ynum.

Their number (you see eight) their figure and 5
use ensues.

The Comma hath its place at the foot of the line,
and is marked with a senii-circulor forme like an
halfe Moone decrescent thus (,) The use onely in
long sentences, in the most convenient places to 10
make a small pause for the necessity of breathing3
or in Rhetoricall speeches (where many other words
are used to one effect) to make a kinde of Emphasis
and deliberation for the greater niajesty or state of
the Elocution. 15

The Comma-colon, as you see by the name,
participates of both the Comma and the Colom The
one retaining his proper place, the other above the
figure thus (ς) This to the Ancients was not knowne3
but now in no lesse use than estimation, especially 20
among Rhetoricians. Who in their long winded sen-
tene-es, and reduplications, have it as a constant
lutek—horse, to lnake some short deliberation as it
were of little sentences7 us the Comma (loth of words:
the time of pause about double that of the (7077217126125
generally, which yet is very small.

The (solon (which we vulgarly call two prickes
or points) is deciphered in the forme of two periods⁷
the one ut the foot, the other at the upper part of
the body of the line, thus (2) It is chiefly used in the 30
division of sentences, and exacts halfe the pause of a
Period: and halfe as much nguine as a Comma Colon.

The Periocl is onely a single point7 set at the lower

part of the body of the line thus (.) This is altogetheg
use
