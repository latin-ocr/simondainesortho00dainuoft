84 ORTHOEPIA, or,

some request to make. And in generall, it is more
tolerable to be argued 01 100 plaine a stile, (so as
I said, it be done with due respect) than by any
Rhetoricall 11031103 01 elocution, to incurre the 0011-
sure 01 a Sycophant, as it is incident and usuall to 5
such as use many words 10 little purpose, to be
either 1¹eJected as idle and impertinent, or els
suspected of some further plot, than perhaps the
party himselfe is guilty of. Let therefore your Letters
01 what nature soever, be as succinet as possible 10
may be, without circumlocutions, which be tedious
10 Persons 01 quality, and such as have much busi-
nesse. And 11 11 be so, as they be replete with
matters 01 consequence, come presently 10 1110 busi-
nesse 01 111031 importance, conveniently introduced:15
then persist in order, 101· otherwise, 11 your Letter
be copious, and carries not (as the Proverbe sayes)
meat in the mouth, or matter at the entrance, it
may hazzard (11 1101 well sollicited) to be cast by,
without so much as once reading over, as I have 20
knowne some my 30110 among men 01 worth, who
have been much imployed.

This Ι speake not though, utterly to debarre
the use 01 civill Complement, which is both requi-
site, and 110 wayes inconvenient, so it be used 25
with discretiori, and not (as they say) to make
a paine 01 pastime. Complement therefore is most
seasonable, when it accompanies either present or
visit, I meane aswell in paper as in person. And
that alwayes better introduced in the close 01 030
Letter, than at the beginning3 unlesse the whole
subject be onely by way 01 complement, and
nothing concerning any serious businesse. A
thing ordinary, and many times expected betweene
