from the Latine, as condique, of condiynus; oppuyne
of oppetfflzo the Verb3 benique, of beni-qun&- &c M we
find thus combined, chiefly in words either mediately
or immediately comming from the Greeke3 as will
appeare by comparing this place with our treatise of 5
asmo, in the syllables mixt.

The manner of pronouncing them is thus as
followes. Frame your voice as if you would sound
all the letters, and withall the E3 but so scone as
you have pronounced the two consonants, there stop, 10
and omit the E. As for example.

hle, fable, ᾖ bl, ] fabl.

cle, uncle, ἕ cl, uwel.

dle, fidle, ς) (ΙΙ, fidl.

με), τηγιρ, Ξ» sl, tretfc. 15
yle, amylo, ἑ) ΗΖ, anyl.

ple, - in φορῶ, :E ⁴ pl, *quasi yrappl.

tle, mantle, ἕέ tl, mantl.

cre, aere, ἕ er, aer.

yre, (effre, g qr, (ἐφ’. 20 y
sme, baptisme‚ 5 sm, baptism.

9²²0> benique, Q: yn, benifflz.

And so in the rest‚ whensoever they shall happen
thus combined in the end of a word. As likewise
when these combinations befall with es finall, being 25
either the plurals to these substantives of the singular
number, or the third person singular in the present
tense of the indicative mood of such as be Verbes‚
you shall promumce them altogether with the omission

of Ε, as more plainely appeares in this ensuing 30

Table.
