 

The Art of riyht speakiozq. 71

 

used at the end of every speech or sentence, as the
name it selfe implies (being derived from the Greek)
and signifies conclusion. The pause or distance of
speaking hereto appropriate is sometime more, some-
5 time lesse: for (setting aside the Epilogicall distinc—
tion, as it terminates whole treatises) when in the
middle of a line it cuts off any integral] part of a
complete Tractate, which goes not on with the same,
but begins a new line, it requireth double the time

10 of pause, that it doth when the Treatise persists in
the same line: being then foure times as long as a
Colon, which in the same line is but twice.

I remember my singing-Master taught nie to
keep time, by telling from 1, to 4, according to the
15 nature of the time which I was to keep, and I found
the practice thereos much ease and certainty to me,
tin I was perfect in it. The same course Ι have
used to my pupils in their reading, to inure them
to the distinction of their pauses, and found it no
20 lesse successefull.

But here you must take notice, that many times
this point or period marke is many times set after
great or Capitall Letters single; not for any pause or
distance of time, but onely as a note of abbreviation

25 of some proper name, or other word beginning with
‘the same letter. Which you shall thus distinguish.
For if the point succeeds such a capitall letter, it
argues onely an abbreviation, and no time of pause:
but if the great letter succeeds the point, it argues

30 onely a period pause, and no abbreviation. For as
in Orthography such abbreviations ought to be marked
with such a point3 so every Periocl ought to have a
Capitall Letter immediately succeeding.
