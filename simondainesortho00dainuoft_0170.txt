Of the sozcre Liqzce'ds, L, M, N, R, when they

lzappen in the end of α word.

Otwithstanding in the division 01 Consonants, I

merrily said, Liquids were onely made to suit a
Ladies mouth: yet in respect experience finds the 5
necessity, that enforceth the generall acceptance 01
1110111 111 0111· Tongue; Ι have thought good 10 propose
this little Treatise 01 1110111 111 peculiar: the rather, in

word, we need 1101 their distinction3 unlesse it be,
because L and R be most incident to combinations,
under any other consonant, wherein there is 011 ap—
