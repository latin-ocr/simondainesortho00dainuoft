Αἱ, we pronounce according to the Latin, as in
faire, ἁο. exeepting hait-e, which we sound as 11 it
were written hare, but a little brisker, or rather like
lzeare‚· and the verb say, which we for brevity sake
eall sn,- and suist, as sest,· saith, as salla said, as
sed the Latin Coujunction, &c though irregularly.

ila, the Dipthong we usually sound after the
manner 01 the Latine Aa, except in balmae the
herb, where it sounds A (as the French pronounee
it) full.

Ea, we sound like the Latin E, and it is alwaies
proper, or invariablez 01101)ν 111 Phleayme (which we
l)‹1›i·1·ow 01 the Greeke φλέγμα) it is 101· the most
part sounded with Ε short, and G omitted, as in
Phleme.

Ee, is alwaies the same 111 pronunciation with
the Greek η and the Latin I. asI said in the Vowels.

Εἰ, we generally promtuume like the Latin Af,
with little differenee 01 sound, as in receive, stret'yht‚

ake. And what force the Latinos give to their Εἰ 20

Dipthong, wee attribute the same in eft'eet to our
single I, as 111 the Vowels is said: where note, wee
abusively sounsl the word Hez're, or Inheritour, like
Az're, uuaspirate and full, as 11 there were no dif-

ferenee 01 Letters. But where Gla succeeds, the2

Dipthong is sounded shorter, and Gla loseth all its
faculty, as eseiyht, quasi walt &c Some pronounce
Εἰ like Εα 111 many words, and t'or the same pur-
pose write it so too, but altogether against rule or

authtnityg as recem-e, 101· νεσθίυθς eoneecwe, for eon· 30

celse, «ke. especially where it precedeth V.

Eo, we pronounee 111 jeopccrdy and Leoparcl
with the omission 01 0, in Geomelrgy with the losse
01 Ε, and G different from it selfe in power

when it goes before ί), calling it jometrys short. 35

Only in Geogyraphy this Dipthoug is proper, and
in it selfe complete: but we make little us}
