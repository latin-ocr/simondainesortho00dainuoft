thus divided, unlesse perchance it may so happen,
that H interposeth the two extreme consonants
(which very rarely is seen but in the beginning of
a word) and so make a semi—double combinati0n3
5 for then all consonants fall to the latter syllable, as
in be-shrew. This kinde of combinations be onely in
some peculial· words, and not much usuall, especially
Chr, Phr, Ser, Sele, Slzr, Str, T hr, more frequently
occurre.

10 ·4 If foure Consonants come together (as more
cannot) and make a double conibination, they must
be equally divided. But if the first be a single
consonant, and the other combined, take up the
single consonant, and let the other three fall, as in

15 eon—straine, en-thrall: so ἑ contra.

5 If three vowels come together, not being a
Tripthong, or combined in one syllable. If the
former be a dipthong, and the other a single vowell,
as in bayard, take up the dipthong in the first

20 syllable, and let the vowell fall to the latter: and
so on the contrary part.

6 If X, as it often (loth occurre in the middle
of a word, you shall alwaies take it up in the former
syllable, though there be no other consonant follow

25 wherewith to begin the latter: because it implies
the force of es, which is no combination that can
begin a syllable (in the English or Latin, but usuall
in the Greeke) end it may, and frequently doth.

Lastly, when two complete words are coni-

sopounded, or together united in one, you shall in
the spelling have respect unto them, as they were
both simple, as in scere-quarti, which bath but two
syllables. The like is to bee had in Derivatives,
